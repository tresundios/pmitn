                        <p>The emblem consists of a globe that represents the world in which we live. From this globe are emerging different types of six chained hands. These hands basically represent the six different groups of people mentioned in the gospel of Matthew (Mt 25:31ff) who are oppressed, imprisoned, bonded, neglected, and rejected by society, such as prisoners, prostitutes, beggars, street children, AIDS victims, drug addicts, and mental patients.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some of these rejected people can be disappointed and tired, while others are violent and revolutionary. They unsuccessfully break their bonds themselves. They are like the dry bones in Ezekiel's vision (Ez 37:1-14) that are badly in need of life and spirit.</p>
                        
                        <p>To this world of darkness comes the dove, which represents the Holy Spirit. This is the same Holy Spirit who descended on Jesus during His baptism when heaven opened and the Father declared, "You are my Son; today I have fathered you" (Lk 3:21-22). The dove also stands for Prison Ministry, bringing the fruits and gifts of the Holy Spirit such as love, joy, freedom, peace, hope, and consolation to the prisoner.</p>
                        
                        <p>It also symbolizes the messenger of peace in the book of Genesis (Gen 8:8-12) and the Angel who appeared at the Oak of Mamre to announce the good news to Abraham and Sarah (Gen 18:1-15). In the same way, it symbolizes Jesus the Good Shepherd (Jn 10) who goes in search of His lost sheep, and Jesus who joined the disciples on the road to Emmaus and revealed to them the mystery and meaning behind His passion and death (Lk 24:13-25).</p>
                        
                        <p>Thus, to the world of darkness filled with the works of self-indulgence, PMI goes to sow the works of the Spirit. This clearly indicates how much caution is to be taken in this ministry. As Jesus Himself said, "Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves" (Lk 10:3). Therefore, "be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Mt 10:16).</p>
                        
                        <p>According to the liturgical traditions of the Israelites, the dove, like the paschal lamb, is a bird used for sacrifice. In this sense, the PMI member who represents the dove should be ready to sacrifice himself as Jesus did on Mount Calvary in order to have life and have it to the full.</p>
